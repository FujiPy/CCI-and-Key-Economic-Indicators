## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between the **Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)** and key **macroeconomic indicators** such as unemployment, inflation, GDP growth, mortgage interest rates, and household income. There are two main objectives:

1. **Analyze how current macroeconomic conditions shape consumer sentiment** using regression models.
2. **Evaluate whether CCI can serve as a leading indicator** to forecast future economic outcomes.

Using machine learning models including **polynomial regression**, **ridge regression**, and **random forests**, I quantified both coincident and forward-looking relationships between economic fundamentals and CCI. I also visualized variable trends over time and examined feature importance across models.

## Key Findings

- **Polynomial Ridge Regression** achieved an RÂ² of **0.91**, indicating strong alignment between macroeconomic inputs and CCI.
- **Random Forest Regression** outperformed linear models with an RÂ² of **0.95** and RMSE of **6.02**, showing high predictive accuracy for current sentiment.
- When treating **CCI as a 6 month leading indicator**, it forecasted **housing price levels** and **household income** moderately well (RÂ² = 0.70 and 0.56), but had **low predictive power** for policy-driven variables like inflation or mortgage rates.
- Top predictive variables included **unemployment rate**, **home prices**, and **household income**, reflecting real economic conditions most visible to consumers.

## Business & Policy Application

This framework offers real value to **economic policymakers and analysts**, enabling data-driven understanding of how macro conditions influence public sentiment. It also supports **early warning systems** by examining sentiment's ability to forecast future economic realities, especially in consumer-driven sectors like housing and retail.
